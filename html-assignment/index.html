                <h3>A little hint about me</h3>
                <p>
                    Everyone knows me as a quiet and timid girl personally I feel they're wrong. I can be very loud if I want to be. I just don't find it necessary. People often believe my face is a representation of my personality. They all think I'm innocent, kind, caring and always scared of little things. Personally, I like to think of myself as a green snake under green grass and the only thing that can freak me out is color yellow. Lonart, the malaria medicine comes to mind. Anytime I see Lonart or similar colors, I feel sick.
                    I'm not like other girls in the aspects of emotion and junk foods. I don't like chocolate, yogurt, donuts etc anything sugary food is a no no for me. I'm the opposite of my appearance, what you see is not always what you get so never <b>judge a book by its cover</b>
